"""
The first approach to this problem would be to iterate over the array 
and check all possible pairs of numbers, but that would be 
a O(nÂ²) solution. A less naive approach would be to iterate over
the array and adding the items to an hash table. 
Whenever adding a item, you would check if there is the complement needed
to reach the target in the hash table, giving us a O(n) solution.
